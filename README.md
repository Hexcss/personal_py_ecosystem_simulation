# PySimulation

PySimulation is an ecosystem simulator built using Python. The application creates an environment where entities such as sheep, pigs, and cows roam around a dynamically rendered world. The simulator not only allows users to watch these entities in action but also brings in factors like weather patterns and cloud movement, making the simulation more intricate and captivating.

## Features

- **Dynamic World Rendering**: Experience a real-time rendering of the world where you can see the positions, health, and paths of different entities.
- **Entity Spawning**: Witness the automated random spawning of entities including sheep, pigs, and cows.
- **Entity Interaction**: With a simple mouse click, users can select or deselect entities. Selected entities play a distinctive sound effect and their movement paths become visible.
- **Ambient Sound**: The simulator is equipped with ambient music generated by Mubert, ensuring an immersive user experience.
- **Advanced Perlin Noise Algorithm**: PySimulation uses a custom-made PerlinNoise algorithm, optimized with Cython, ensuring smooth and realistic terrain and environment generation.
- **Weather System**: Cloud movements and dynamic weather rendering offer a more detailed simulation.
- **Efficient Camera System**: The camera system displays the current position and offers efficient navigation within the ecosystem.

## Controls

- **Left Mouse Click**: To select an entity.
- **Right Mouse Click**: To deselect an entity.

## TODO

### Camera System:
- **Camera Enhancements**:
  - Upgrade to a more intuitive control scheme, possibly supporting both mouse and keyboard navigation.
  - Implement zoom functionality to allow users to focus on specific areas or entities.
  - Add a minimap for a bird's-eye view of the entire ecosystem.

### Animal Behavior and AI:
- **Animal AI Improvements**:
  - Incorporate thirst and hunger mechanics.
    - Differentiate between water sources: ponds, rivers, and lakes.
    - Differentiate food types: plants, smaller animals, etc.
  - Allow entities to seek out food and water sources.
  - Implement AI states: resting, searching, eating, drinking, fleeing, etc.
  - Introduce a food entity.
    - Create different types of food sources: trees, bushes, grass.
    - Introduce decay mechanics for food left unconsumed.
  
### Rendering and World Creation:
- **Rendering Optimizations**:
  - Transition to chunk-based world rendering.
    - Implement a chunk loader and unloader to save memory.
    - Use level of detail (LOD) techniques for distant chunks.
  - Improve entity culling: Only render entities visible in the viewport.
  - Optimize cloud rendering: Display visible clouds efficiently, perhaps using a 2D cloud map.

### Reproduction and Genetics:
- **Reproduction System**:
  - Design mating rituals or behaviors for entities.
  - Add genetic dynamics: introduce dominant and recessive genes, genetic mutations, etc.
  - Implement offspring growth stages: infant, adolescent, adult.
  
### User Interface and Experience:
- **User Experience**:
  - Revamp the loading screen with captivating animations or visuals.
  - Introduce a main menu:
    - Options for settings: graphics, audio, controls.
    - A tutorial or guide section.
  - Implement a pause menu with options to save, load, or exit.
  - Incorporate feedback systems: tooltips, pop-ups, sound cues.
  - Allow users to save and load simulation states, with multiple save slots.
  
### Environmental Dynamics:
- **Day-Night Cycle**:
  - Implement a realistic day-night transition.
  - Add nocturnal and diurnal entities, with behaviors tied to the time of day.
  - Introduce dynamic lighting, moon phases, and starry skies at night.
  
- **Ecosystem Complexity**:
  - Introduce predators and establish a food chain hierarchy.
  - Add scavenger entities that feed on remains.
  - Implement an aging system: entities grow old and face age-related challenges.

- **Weather System**:
  - Introduce diverse weather phenomena: rain, snow, fog, thunderstorms, etc.
    - Each weather type should impact the ecosystem differently: puddles after rain, decreased visibility in fog, etc.
  - Design entity behaviors in response to weather: seeking shelter during a storm, animals becoming more active after rain, etc.
  - Incorporate seasonal changes: spring, summer, autumn, winter, each affecting the ecosystem in unique ways.

## Note

For contributors or enthusiasts, when delving into the code, one should take note of the custom Perlin Noise algorithm. This algorithm has been meticulously crafted and optimized using Cython for better performance.
